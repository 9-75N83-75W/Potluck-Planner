## Our Purpose:
This project grew from our love of sharing meals together and the challenges food allergies can bring to those moments. With several team members personally affected by allergens and dietary constraints, we set out to create a safer, more inclusive experience. In doing so, it takes the guesswork out of which dish contains with ingredients, by tagging relevant allergens or dietary information on each dish for the users. Meanwhile, hosts have all this information organized and can adequately accommodate for guests.
